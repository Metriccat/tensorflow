# Deep Learning
# =============
# 
# Assignment 1
# ------------
# 
# The objective of this assignment is to learn about simple data curation practices, and familiarize you with some of the data we'll be reusing later.
# 
# This notebook uses the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) dataset to be used with python experiments. This dataset is designed to look like the classic [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, while looking a little more like real data: it's a harder task, and the data is a lot less 'clean' than MNIST.

# These are all the modules we'll be using later. Make sure you can import them
# before proceeding further.

# First, we'll download the dataset to our local machine. The data consists of characters rendered in a variety of fonts on a 28x28 image. The labels are limited to 'A' through 'J' (10 classes). The training set has about 500k and the testset 19000 labelled examples. Given these sizes, it should be possible to train models quickly on any machine.

# ---------

# By construction, this dataset might contain a lot of overlapping samples, including training data that's also contained in the validation and test set! Overlap between training and test can skew the results if you expect to use your model in an environment where there is never an overlap, but are actually ok if you expect to see training samples recur when you use it.
# Measure how much overlap there is between training, validation and test samples.
# 
# Optional questions:
# - What about near duplicates between datasets? (images that are almost identical)
# - Create a sanitized validation and test set, and compare your accuracy on those in subsequent assignments.

# Let's get an idea of what an off-the-shelf classifier can give you on this data. It's always good to check that there is something to learn, and that it's a problem that is not so trivial that a canned solution solves it.
# 
# Train a simple model on this data using 50, 100, 1000 and 5000 training samples. Hint: you can use the LogisticRegression model from sklearn.linear_model.
